% Let's take columns as waveforms, and smooth them to different scales;
% these inputs can be carfac NAPs, for example, and the peaks of the
% smoothed versions can be used as trigger events, even tracking back
% to less-smoothed versions.
% And we'll deciamte 2:1 at every other smoothing.
%
% Until we decide what we want, we'll just plot things, one plot per scale.
