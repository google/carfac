% The layer_array is a struct array containing an entry for each layer
% in a layer of power-of-2 decimated pieces of SAI that get composited
% into a log-lag SAI.
% Each struct has the following fields:
%  .width - number of pixels occupied in the final composite SAI,
%     not counting the overlap into pixels counted for other layers.
%  .target_indices - column indices in the final composite SAI,
%     counting the overlap region(s).
%  .lag_curve - for each point in the final composite SAI, the float index
%     in the layer's buffer to interp from.
%  .alpha - the blending coefficent, mostly 1, tapering toward 0 in the overlap
%     region(s).
% Layer 1 has no overlap to it right, and layer n_layers has none to its
% left, but sizes of the target_indices, lag_curve, and alpha vectors are
% otherwise width + left_overlap + right_overlap.  The total width of the
% final composite SAI is the sum of the widths.
% Other fields could be added to hold state, such as history buffers for
% each layer, or those could go in state struct array...

% Elevate these to a param struct?

% lag) relative to trigger time, has 1 NAP sample per SAI sample.  Other
% layers map more than one NAP sample into 1 SAI sample.  Layer 2 is
% computed as 2X decimated, 2 NAP samples per SAI sample, but then gets
% interpolated to between 1 and 2 (and outside that range in the overlap
% regions) to connect up smoothly.  Each layer is another 2X decimated.
% The last layer limits out at 1 (representing 2^(n_layers) SAI samples)
% at the width_extra_last_layer SAI samples that extend to the far past.
