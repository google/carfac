% This function runs the CARFAC; that is, filters a 1 or more channel
% sound input to make one or more neural activity patterns (naps);
% however, unlike CARFAC_Run, it forces it to be linear, and gives a
% linear (not detected) output.

% only saving one of these, really:

for ear = 1:CF.n_ears
  % make it effectively linear for now
  CF.ears(ear).CAR_coeffs.velocity_scale = 0;
