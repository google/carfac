% function [naps, CF, BM, seg_ohc, seg_agc] = CARFAC_Run_Segment(...
%   CF, input_waves)
%
% This function runs the CARFAC; that is, filters a 1 or more channel
% sound input segment to make one or more neural activity patterns (naps);
% it can be called multiple times for successive segments of any length,
% as long as the returned CF with modified state is passed back in each
% time.
%
% input_waves is a column vector if there's just one audio channel;
% more generally, it has a row per time sample, a column per audio channel.
%
% naps has a row per time sample, a column per filterbank channel, and
% a layer per audio channel if more than 1.
% BM is basilar membrane motion (filter outputs before detection).
%
% the input_waves are assumed to be sampled at the same rate as the
% CARFAC is designed for; a resampling may be needed before calling this.
%
% The function works as an outer iteration on time, updating all the
% filters and AGC states concurrently, so that the different channels can
% interact easily.  The inner loops are over filterbank channels, and
% this level should be kept efficient.
%
% seg_ohc seg_agc are optional extra outputs useful for seeing what the
% ohc nonlinearity and agc are doing; both in terms of extra damping.

% A 2022 addition to make open-loop running behave.  In open_loop mode, these
% coefficients are set, per AGC filter outputs, when we CARFAC_Close_AGC_Loop
% on AGC filter output updates.  They drive the zB and g coefficients to the
% intended value by the next update, but if open_loop they would just keep
% going, extrapolating.  The point of open_loop mode is to stop them moving,
% so we need to make sure these deltas are zeroed in case the mode is switched
% from closed to open, as in some tests to evaluate the transfer functions
% before and after adapting to a signal.
