This directory contains a Python/Numpy implementation of Dick Lyon's
[CARFAC](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/human-and-machine-hearing/carfac-digital-cochlear-model/C8341FBDA54160D3E9B8694A856DD3FF),
(Cascade of Asymmetric Resonators with Fast Acting Compression) model.
It is fully described in his [book](http://www.machinehearing.org/):
  Richard F. Lyon. Human and Machine Hearing. Cambridge University Press, 2017.

This [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17fIMykLMGZHjPfiNSCVyOfNR8u_jE8DQ?usp=sharing) shows some test examples and demonstrates how to use the code.
